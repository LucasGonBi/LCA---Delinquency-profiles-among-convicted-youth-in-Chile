This repository contains selected figures for my forthcoming paper, “Delinquency profiles among convicted youth in Chile: Latent Class Analysis and associated sociodemographic factors.”

**Abstract:** Over the past decade, juvenile delinquency in Chile has undergone significant transformations in offense frequency, offense types, and offending trajectories. This study aims to identify and characterize the offending profiles of adolescents and young people convicted nationwide, examining the sociodemographic factors that shape their configuration. Using Latent Class Analysis (LCA), seven distinct profiles were identified, with recidivism emerging as the main differentiating factor within the largest group of convictions, corresponding to property-related offenses. A multinomial logistic regression model was then employed to test four hypotheses linking sociodemographic variables to the identified offending profiles. The results reveal positive associations between age and more complex offending profiles, between age and recidivist profiles, between drug use and recidivism in property-related offenses, and between being female and profiles linked to drug trafficking. An unanticipated finding shows a positive relationship between profiles associated with sexual offenses and youths from higher socioeconomic strata. Taken together, these findings highlight the criminological and sociodemographic heterogeneity of the population sentenced under the Juvenile Criminal Responsibility Law, contributing to the rethinking of intervention strategies within the restorative framework adopted by the National Service for Juvenile Social Reintegration (SNRSJ).
