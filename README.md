# LCA-Delinquency profiles among convicted youth in Chile
This repository contains selected figures for my forthcoming paper, _“Delinquency profiles among convicted youth in Chile: Latent Class Analysis and associated sociodemographic factors”_

Over the past decade, juvenile delinquency in Chile has undergone significant transformations in offense frequency, offense types, and offending trajectories. This study aims to identify and characterize the offending profiles of adolescents and young people convicted nationwide, examining the sociodemographic factors that shape their configuration. The paper’s **main contribution** is the development of a **typology of convicted adolescents based on their conviction offenses**. Using **Latent Class Analysis (LCA)**, I identify seven criminological profiles, which are summarized in the figure below.

Due to the confidential and sensitive nature of the underlying administrative records, the disaggregated data and processing code cannot be shared publicly. However, the paper (scheduled for publication in June 2026) provides a detailed description of the data-processing and analytical procedures.

The figure displays the probabilities associated with each offense type, using darker red tones to indicate higher probabilities within each identified profile. The analysis was conducted using administrative data from SNRSJ and SENAME. These data are owned by SNRSJ.

A multinomial logistic regression model was then employed to test four hypotheses linking sociodemographic variables to the identified offending profiles. The results reveal positive associations between age and more complex offending profiles, between age and recidivist profiles, between drug use and recidivism in property-related offenses, and between being female and profiles linked to drug trafficking. An unanticipated finding shows a positive relationship between profiles associated with sexual offenses and youths from higher socioeconomic strata. Taken together, these findings highlight the criminological and sociodemographic heterogeneity of the population sentenced under the Juvenile Criminal Responsibility Law, contributing to the rethinking of intervention strategies within the restorative framework adopted by the National Service for Juvenile Social Reintegration (SNRSJ).
